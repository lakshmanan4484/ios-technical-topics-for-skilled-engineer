### Swift Programming

### Objective-C Programming

### iOS Technology 

1. Application Life cycle
2. 

### Design Pattern

1. Cocoa Design Pattern
2. 

### Data Structure & Algorithms

1. Searching
   - AVL Tree | Self Balancing Binary Search Trees
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - Binary Tree
   - Binary Search
   - Depth-Frist Search
   - Linear Search
   - Z-Algorithm

2. Listing
   - Linked list
        - Singly linked list
        - Doubly linked list
        - Reversing linked list
   - Skip-List
3. Queues
   - Stack [Last-in, first-out]
   - Queue [First-in, first-out]
   - Deque [A double-ended queue]
   - Priority Queue [A queue where the most important element is always at the front]
   - Ring Buffer [Also known as a circular buffer. An array of a certain size that conceptually wraps around back to the beginning.]
   
4. Sorting
    - Basic Sort
        - Insertion Sort
        - Selection Sort
        - Shell Sort
    - Fast Sort
        - Quick Sort
        - Merge Sort
        - Heap Sort
    - Hybrid Sort
        - Introsort
    - Special-purpose Sorts
        - Counting Sort
        - Radix Sort
        - Topological Sort
    - Bad Sorting algorithms
